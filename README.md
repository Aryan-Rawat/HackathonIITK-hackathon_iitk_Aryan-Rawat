# DataScienceHackathon
### Online Data Science Hackathon by EICT Academy, IIT

You might ask yourself: Is it possible to predict the weather? What will it be like
tomorrow in Nagaland? What clothing do I need? Weather can be predicted when
looking at historical data and also with the help of data science. The idea behind
data science is to create models that can predict the weather for other days,
weeks or even months. For example, in the case of weather, you can train a model
to predict the weather for tomorrow by looking at data from the past. This model
will show the best weather for tomorrow. It’s not always correct, but it’s a pretty
good option.
Northeastern states of India are considered as a place of varied weather
conditions ranging from snow, rain, storms, etc. A group of researchers from
Guwahati tried to acquire the daily weather data from various sensors that are
managed by a research organization. The researchers were interested in
prediction of tremendous change in the nature of weather and their impact on
the environment.
A snip cut of the whole data had been provided to you with various factors as
follows:
Formatted Date: Includes the date and time of data acquisition.
Summary: Nature of current weather
Precip Type: Precipitation is rain, snow, sleet, or hail — any kind of weather condition
where something's falling from the sky.
Temperature: acquired temperature in degree centigrade.
Apparent Temperature: Apparent temperature is the temperature equivalent perceived
by humans, caused by the combined effects of air temperature, relative humidity and
wind speed.
Humidity: percentage of the moisture content in the atmosphere.
Wind Speed: speed of the wind measured in km/hr
Wind bearing: wind bearing measured in degrees. It indicates the direction toward which an
object is moving.
Visibility: visible range in km. Visibility is a measure of the horizontal opacity of the
atmosphere at the point of observation and is expressed in terms of the horizontal
distance at which a person should be able to see and identify.
Cloud Cover: Cloud cover (also known as cloudiness, cloudage, or cloud amount) refers
to the fraction of the sky obscured by clouds when observed from a particular location.
Pressure : Pressure of the environment in millibars.
Daily Summary: Daily forecast.

### Q. Your task is to analyze the given scene. Find the reports of the weather in a graphical
### pattern, encode the necessary with different python tools and finally train with different
### machine learning tools to produce output which could serve as the target that is the
### same as daily summary when new data comes into play. Also find the accuracy metrics
### such that the number of false positives are less than the true positives and also the
### accuracy is optimized. 

### File name should be your hackathon_ID.ipynb
### e.g. for individuals file name : DS_EICT2005.ipynb and for Team TDS_EICT2001.ipynb
